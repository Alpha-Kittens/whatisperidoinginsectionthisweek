            <p>Okay so, the votes here are incredibly close. I am strongly partial towards doing Euler-Lagrange. 
                I love this topic and think it will be significantly easier to relate to the material of the class 
                we've covered this semester, and (perhaps more importantly) I genuinely can't remember how my first 
                exposure to quantum mechanics went and so I'd have to do some research on how people approach this. 
                I've tried digging around and ultimately I think trying to put something together that I feel 
                comfortable showing to complete beginners is going to take a lot more preparation than the very 
                shiny alternative here. 
            </p>
            <p>So, I'm going to go with Euler-Lagrange. I'm sorry to all the quantum enjoyers out 
                there! Thanks for bearing with me. Hope to see you there! -Peri </p>
